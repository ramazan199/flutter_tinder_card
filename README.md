## How to pass the card data

Here we are using a common data structure for the card detail 
Here i'm usind a model class for the data handling
```dart

class Profile {
  final List<String> photos;
  final String name;
  final String bio;

  Profile({this.photos, this.name, this.bio});
}
```
adding some dummy data to the Profile model
```dart
//dummy data
final List<Profile> demoProfiles = [
  new Profile(
    photos: [
      "assets/3.jpg",
      "assets/2.jpg",
      "assets/1.jpg",
      "assets/3.jpg",
      "assets/2.jpg",
      "assets/1.jpg",
    ],
    name: "Aneesh G",
    bio: "This is the person you want",
  ),
];

```
